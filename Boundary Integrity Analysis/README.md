Boundary Integrity Analysis is done semi-manually, using "plot profile" in ImageJ.  Open the RFP channel with the image volume orientated in 4-chamber.  After drawing a line across the RV->LV, more or less axially to the heart, use Analyze -> Plot Profile to identify the relative middle position of the IVS.  Recommend single or double blinding.  The only two numbers captured from the plot profile are 1. the relative middle of the IVS in microns, and 2. the total width of the line drawn from RV to LV epicardium also in microns.  The quotient of those two numbers is the "relative position" of the IVS, which can be dotplotted (or violin, or box, etc).
